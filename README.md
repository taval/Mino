=======================================

![Mino screenshot](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Mino screenshot")

Features:
---------
- allows drag and drop sorting
- instant visual feedback
- tagging for categorization purposes, with option for creation of ad-hoc tags or to only allow existing tags
- set priority level to visualize importance of a particular note
- (text editor form only) **bold** formatting (toggle with ctrl-B key combination)
- (text editor form only) _italic_ formatting (toggle with ctrl-I key combination)

Issues:
-------
- text entry character rate is slow
- empty titles not disposed of after application close

Planned improvements:
---------------------
- filter by tag or priority
- marking existing items as complete

Future potential improvements:
------------------------------
- file compilation and export
- mobile app with comparable functionality to this one
- expansion of the concept to facilitate server-based collaborative issue tracking
